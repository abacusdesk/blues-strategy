<h1>Blues Marketing Ideas</h1>

<p>There are two parts of any marketing or advertising effort:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Brand awareness (works in long term and decides which brands will survive, repetition is a part of it) – eg. Facebook presence.</li>
	<li>Lead generation (works in short term and demands good up front fund allocation because of competition) – eg. Google Ads</li>
</ol>

<p>These two work hand in hand for big brands, for example Coca-Cola as a brand won’t survive without long term branding. But to keep its investors happy, it also needs to focus on sales and quarterly earnings.</p>

<p>So, advertising for Coca-Cola serves both purposes. And the balance between these two, brand awareness and lead generation is very very important.</p>

<p>For small to medium businesses though, the situation is different as SMEs don’t have that kind of budgets as Fortune 500 companies do.</p>

<p>So it all comes down to allocation of funding for maximum ROI in both brand awareness and lead generation. In your case, we are going to distribute it 70:30.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<p>Competition in your field is brutal. Digital marketing is nothing but an extension of more traditional marketing techniques, just the medium is different.</p>

<p>So it all comes down to human attention. This is reason why Hindware has hired Shahrukh Khan and Cera has hired Sonam Kapoor as their brand ambassadors.</p>

<p>They have got the resources, Hindware market cap is 3,318 crores while Cera’s is 4,442 crore. Apart from that, in Google ads space, we are not just competing against the manufacturers, ie Cera, Hindware, Roca, Kohler etc, but also the retailers, ie Parryware, Amazon, Flipkart etc.</p>

<p>This is the reason why we are going to distribute our budgets 70:30, 70% for brand awareness and 30% for lead generation. Because competition head to head against these big players is not practical at this stage.</p>

<p>For brand awareness and lead generation we are going to take the most efficient approach possible. Facebook is where people spend most of their time, so we are going to run brand awareness campaign here only.</p>

<p>When people are looking for products, they naturally go to Google. Here we are going to run ads for lead generation.</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>Planned budget: 1 Lac per month</p>

<p>Brand awareness (Facebook): 70%</p>

<p>Lead generation (Google Ads): 30%</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
	<li>A landing page for AdWords campaign</li>
	<li>Improving the overall website</li>
</ul>
